# Break-Out Test Minigame

This project was made in Godot as a part of me learning how to mess around with the engine. This is the second project I made in this modality, the first one being a Pong clone. Hope you enjoy it.
Controls:

    ENTER: START (used in title screen to start a new game)
    ESC: RESET (Can be used to reset the game and go back to the title screen)
    Left and Right arrow keys: Left and Right respectively to move the paddle 

You can play the game here: https://matiashettich.itch.io/break-out-minigame-test
